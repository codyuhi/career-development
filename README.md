# Career Development

## Summary

This repository holds files that represent my career development as an engineer in the tech industry. I have a varied and extensive history that provides great value wherever I go. This repository is a way to share and keep track of the career development that I see over time.
## Repository Contents

- `resume-archive/`: A directory that holds all the resumes that I've created and used in the past to get positions in the tech industry, sorted by year. Each subdirectory, labeled by year, holds information about where I was at in my career during different times of that year.
- `^Cody Uhi Resume (Spring|Summer|Fall|Winter) 20[0-9]+\.docx$`: A docx file for my resume that is kept here for easy iteration as updates need to be made to the resume.
- `^Cody Uhi Resume (Spring|Summer|Fall|Winter) 20[0-9]+\.pdf$`: A pdf file for my resume that is used as the primarily shared resume file, since PDFs have a reputation for maintaining their formatting across devices.
